# Formula Language

## Current state

- JS is still the semantic oracle
- canonical production routing is closed for `431` of `431` canonical rows
- `0` canonical rows remain `implemented-js`
- `0` canonical rows remain `blocked`
- the generated source of truth is
  `packages/formula/src/__tests__/fixtures/formula-compatibility-snapshot.json`

## Canonical corpus milestone

The active milestone is the canonical Excel for the web worksheet formula corpus represented in `packages/formula/src/compatibility.ts`.

The current code-backed canonical registry contains `431` rows.

There are no non-production canonical rows.

The canonical grouped-array SUM forms for `GROUPBY` and `PIVOTBY` now route through internal
native grouped-array builtins on the wasm path.

## Google Sheets compatibility subset

`QUERY` is supported for local WorkPaper ranges, not provider-backed Sheets data.
The current deterministic subset covers:

- `select` column projections
- `where` comparisons against scalar literals
- `group by` with projected group columns plus `sum(column)` and `count(column)`
- `order by`, `limit`, and `offset`
- bounded `label` clauses for selected output columns and supported aggregate outputs

Unsupported Google Visualization Query Language clauses such as `pivot`,
`having`, `format`, and `options` still fail closed with `#VALUE!`.

## Full target

The full formula target remains Excel 365 worksheet parity as of `2026-03-15`, including:

- absolute and mixed refs
- quoted sheet refs
- unions and intersections
- `%`, `@`, `#`
- array literals
- defined names
- tables and structured references
- dynamic arrays
- `LET`
- `LAMBDA`

## Host and service function boundary

The worksheet engine keeps non-worksheet Excel surfaces behind the adapter contract in `packages/formula/src/external-function-adapter.ts`.

- native builtins stay focused on the worksheet corpus tracked in this package
- cube, web, host-backed, external-data, add-in-like, and Python-in-Excel surfaces register through `installExternalFunctionAdapter()`
- adapters can expose scalar or range-aware functions to the JS evaluator
- adapted functions do **not** receive a `BuiltinId` and do **not** enter the WASM fast path
- known provider-backed functions such as `PY`, `COPILOT`, `TRANSLATE`, `IMPORTRANGE`, `GOOGLEFINANCE`, and cube/web data functions fail closed as `#BLOCKED!` when no adapter is installed
- Google Sheets import functions such as `IMPORTRANGE`, `IMPORTDATA`, `IMPORTHTML`, `IMPORTXML`, `IMPORTFEED`, and `GOOGLEFINANCE` are compatibility hooks: a host adapter must fetch or authorize the provider data, then return scalar values or imported cells to the evaluator

## Semantic rules

- Excel for the web is the behavior oracle
- visible error strings follow Excel codes
- JS and WASM must not diverge on coercion, blanks, error precedence, spill blocking, or lookup comparison rules
- a canonical row is not complete until production execution can route it through WASM
