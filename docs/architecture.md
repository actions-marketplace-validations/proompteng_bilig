```

## Active seams

- `@bilig/core`
  - workbook state
  - transactions
  - metadata
  - formula/runtime execution
  - canonical `@bilig/workbook` run adapter for materializing generic commands and proving generic checks
  - snapshot import/export
- `@bilig/workbook`
  - WorkPaper-first workbook model API
  - root public barrel plus smaller model/prepare/find/check/formula/verify/runtime/command/schema subpath exports
  - public JSON schema artifacts, deterministic schema hashes, and checked-in
    fixtures for non-TypeScript agent contract inspection
  - schema/checker parity for shape-enforceable row predicates, command
    bundles, and proof payloads, with semantic scope limits enforced by
    `checkWorkbookCommandBundle`
  - model-manifest schema artifacts for action discovery and input contracts
  - runtime-requirements schema artifacts for adapter handoff inspection
  - exact run-result proof schema for apply summaries, command receipts, undo
    refs, and unverified proof notes
  - phase-scoped find/check/action contexts
  - frozen workbook refs with non-enumerable ergonomic helpers
  - frozen public helper namespaces for find/check/formula construction
  - JSON-safe ref data plus hydration helpers for agent/runtime transport
  - own-data-only ref discovery and hydration, with accessors ignored instead
    of invoked during planning and transport
  - data-only ref array traversal and known-field ref cloning without
    enumerable-property spread
  - frozen plan refs containers with `refsUsed` verification
  - frozen JSON-safe descriptions for model/ref/plan/result inspection
  - transported plan data through `toPlanData`, `hydratePlanData`, and
    `verifyPlanData`
  - structured `checkPlanData` diagnostics for JSON handoff payloads
  - own-enumerable-data transported plan arrays before hydration or execution
  - transported plan execution through `runWorkbookPlan` without requiring the
    consumer's private `refs` object shape
  - generic selector validation before runtime handoff, including canonical table-header selectors and row predicate value contracts
  - JSON-safe action input planning and verification
  - own-data-only action input and input-metadata normalization, with accessors
    rejected instead of invoked before model code runs
  - action-object metadata, constrained input descriptions, and `checkInput`
    payload checks for agent manifests
  - transported model-manifest validation through `checkWorkbookModelDescription`
  - data-only action-name validation before model lookup, so malformed runtime
    keys fail without caller-owned coercion
  - frozen model inspection and action-plan result wrappers
  - canonical `prepareWorkbookAction` preflight for plan, verification,
    `planData`, `planId`, and runtime requirements in one agent-facing result
  - machine-readable readback checks for runtime proof
  - readback proof attached to passed value/formula checks
  - transported readback-proof validation through `checkWorkbookReadbackProof`
  - exact readback target validation, including duplicate-target rejection
  - frozen validator and readback-proof verdicts for stable agent handoff
  - frozen run results for inspect-once apply/readback/check proof
  - stable run error code union for predictable agent branching
  - null-prototype model action manifests with own-action-only planning
  - transport-neutral run adapters for preview/apply/readback/check proof
  - strict run mode for one-flag agent-safe checks-before-mutation,
    apply/plan/revision/concrete-op/resolved-concrete-ref, and passed-check
    proof
  - formula label verification against parsed formula reference tokens instead
    of substring matches
  - formula readback proof with parsed label materialization, so symbolic
    formula intent can be verified without hardcoded workbook models or
    human-facing cell UI assumptions
  - runtime adapter capability checks before mutation handoff
  - runtime adapter conformance checks through `@bilig/workbook/testing`, with
    own-data-only option handling before strict proof runs
  - advanced feature/plugin handoff isolated behind `@bilig/workbook/features`
  - bundle-scoped receipt changed-range validation for command proof
  - duplicate command-id rejection for inspectable command bundles
  - frozen command/feature/result/receipt validator verdicts for generic
    runtime handoff
  - structured `checkRuntimeRequirements` diagnostics for transported adapter
    handoff payloads
  - `checkRuntimeAdapter` invalid-requirements verdicts instead of thrown
    exceptions for malformed transported adapter handoff data
  - own-enumerable-data runtime requirement arrays and nested ref arrays before
    adapter validation
  - frozen normalized runtime requirement handoffs before agents trust adapter
    checklists
  - feature command request validation before runtime-owned workbook extension
    dispatch
  - feature command receipt validation before agents trust runtime extension
    evidence
  - accepted command results that reject settled proof fields before runtime
    receipts exist
  - semantic receipt-status validation and receipt-derived command result
    summaries
  - canonical feature receipt op matching that ignores property order while
    rejecting invalid or accessor-backed op arrays before proof comparison
  - feature plugin manifest validation before consumer-owned extension
    registration
  - frozen feature vocabulary lists for agent tool manifests and UI handoff
  - check-only runtime execution that skips mutation when no apply capability
    is required
  - apply summaries that expose preview ops, applied ops, preview/apply match,
    and unverified apply facts
  - command-level apply receipts that bind each planned high-level command to
    the materialized preview and applied operations returned by a runtime
  - receipt op validation that rejects self-consistent proof when the materialized
    op does not match the planned command's concrete workbook op
  - strict command proof that rejects empty materialized ops unless the receipt
    carries command-bound no-op and command-effect evidence, and rejects missing or stale
    resolved-ref evidence for ref-targeting commands; low-level `op` commands
    must prove the full planned op, not only the op kind
  - run-result descriptions that preserve command-bound no-op proof instead of
    collapsing already-satisfied commands into unprovable empty receipt data,
    with persisted-description validation that rejects no-op proof detached from
    the receipt command kind, digest, effect kind, empty-op invariant, or full
    low-level op effect
  - failed run ledgers that preserve changed summaries and undo metadata after
    runtime apply, but keep `changed: []` when failed apply proof reports no
    applied ops and no undo
  - generic check verifier handoff for runtime-owned invariants
  - own-field-only runtime proof validation for adapter apply results, undo
    refs, runtime errors, and check verifier output
  - own-enumerable-data runtime preview ops, applied ops, undo ops, runtime
    errors, and verifier proof before cloning or preview/apply comparison
  - own-field-only feature receipt changed-range validation
  - own-enumerable-data feature manifest arrays, receipt ops, undo ops, ranges,
    and errors before freezing or runtime proof comparison
  - object-record feature plugin manifests, command descriptors, projection
    interceptors, and UI contributions before runtime registration
  - object-record model roots and returned checks before model planning or
    whole-model verification
  - object-record action, check, formula, and verification option roots before
    helper output is recorded or described
  - transport-neutral workbook ops and txns with own-field-only public guards
  - accessor-free low-level op fields, nested fields, and op arrays before
    runtime guard acceptance
- `packages/zero-sync`
  - Zero schema
  - query registry
  - mutator definitions
  - generic `workbook.applyWorkbookPlanData` mutation schema for transported
    `@bilig/workbook` model plans
  - runtime config
- `apps/web`
  - worker-first shell
  - Zero bridge
  - grid integration
- `apps/bilig`
  - session/auth boot
  - Zero query/mutate endpoints
  - authoritative write path
  - recalc/materialization
  - agent APIs
  - authoritative agent apply validates the existing app command bundle through
    the generic `@bilig/workbook` command-bundle handoff before mutation
  - agent execution records require generic `WorkbookCommandResult` proof for
    the exact accepted bundle and applied revision before persistence
  - authoritative transported `WorkbookPlanData` apply runs through the
    `@bilig/core` strict workbook adapter, persists the original generic plan,
    concrete applied ops, and frozen run-result description, and rolls back
    runtime ops when post-apply proof fails

## Removed topology

The following are not current architecture anymore:

- standalone `apps/local-server`
- standalone `apps/sync-server`
- separate CRDT-first browser sync authority
- Redis on the correctness path

## Product rules

- authoritative workbook ordering happens on the server
- Zero syncs relational source/eval state rather than whole-workbook snapshots
- the UI consumes viewport patches, not raw engine internals
- snapshots remain warm-start artifacts, not the hot synced model
- `@bilig/workbook` models stay consumer-defined and domain-neutral
- `@bilig/workbook` plans are inspectable data before runtime execution
- `@bilig/workbook` runtime proof binds both the whole plan and each planned
  command to the materialized workbook ops before an agent trusts apply results
- `@bilig/workbook` command bundles are revision-bound, idempotent, ordered,
  range-scoped, explicitly destructive, and require declared touched ranges when
  a scope cell limit is present before runtime execution
- app-owned agent command bundles must pass through the generic
  `@bilig/workbook` command-bundle validator before preview/apply execution
- app-owned agent execution records must carry the validated generic command
  result proof after authoritative apply
- `@bilig/workbook` results must expose proof for runtime apply and passed
  checks, preserve changed/undo evidence after post-apply failures, or preserve
  the unverified state instead of hiding it behind a done status
- transported model plans are persisted as generic plan data, materialized
  applied ops, and frozen run-result descriptions; replay uses the applied ops,
  while agents inspect the plan/result proof instead of a human spreadsheet UI
  state
- live ergonomic refs and transported refs are validated through structured
  `checkWorkbookRef` / `checkWorkbookRefData` boundaries before transport or
  hydration, so selector/ref failures report stable paths instead of
  disappearing behind boolean guards; transported ref roots and nested range,
  row predicate, table, and rows refs must be object-record data
- persisted run-result descriptions are validated through a structured
  `checkWorkbookRunResultDescription` boundary, so invalid proof reports stable
  paths instead of collapsing to an unhelpful boolean

## Recommended next focus

1. keep reducing projection churn and render write amplification
2. keep tightening CI, rollout, and rebuild validation around the monolith path
3. keep closing the remaining non-production canonical formula rows
