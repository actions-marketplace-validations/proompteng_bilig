# Generic workbook workflow comparison

The goal is domain-neutral workbook workflow support. Bilig must import and operate on ordinary `.xlsx` workbooks without branching on a workbook name, sheet name, vendor label, business process, or one reference file.

## Goal

Bilig should improve the normal workbook flow:

- import arbitrary `.xlsx` files through the same UI path
- preserve sheet order, formulas, literal values, date serials, number formats, column widths, row heights, merged ranges, and mappable cell styles
- keep formulas visible in the formula bar after import
- keep formatting, border, merge, hide, unhide, freeze, autofit, undo, and redo operations available after import
- verify behavior with multiple generated workbook shapes plus an optional local external workbook smoke test

## Verified Generic Fixtures

The browser import path uses generated fixtures that are intentionally not tied to one business domain:

- `multi-sheet-operations`: dashboard, ledger, rollforward, and lookup sheets with cross-sheet formulas, dimensions, and merged title rows
- `single-sheet-planning`: one-sheet monthly planning schedule with date serials, month formulas, totals, dimensions, and a merged title row
- generated import UI fixtures: tracked deterministic workbooks that cover sheets, formulas, dimensions, and normal import behavior without depending on an operator-local file

The import unit tests cover the same generic behavior below the UI layer and assert that no file-specific dispatch is required.

## Current Generic Advantages

- Imported formulas remain editable and inspectable as formulas.
- Imported values keep primitive workbook types instead of being flattened into display strings.
- Column widths, row heights, and merged ranges are represented in workbook metadata.
- Mappable fills, font settings, alignment, and borders are converted into Bilig style records.
- Unsupported workbook features produce explicit warnings instead of pretending to import perfectly.

## Known Gaps

- Comments and defined names are still ignored.
- Indexed and theme colors are only imported when the library exposes enough direct color data.
- The generated fixtures do not prove every real-world workbook shape.
- This does not claim Google Sheets collaboration parity.
- There is no domain-specific built-in template in this goal.

## Completion Bar

This goal is complete only when all of these are true:

- generic import unit coverage passes for multiple workbook shapes
- browser import coverage passes through the visible UI for multiple generated workbook shapes
- the optional external verifier can validate any supplied local `.xlsx` without encoding that workbook's domain
- the toolbar does not expose a domain-specific hardcoded template
- `pnpm run ci` is green on the final committed tree
